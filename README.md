# Utility for GitLab Reviews

**This is a work in progress**

A utility to quicky checkout a GitLab MR with the following features:

 * Get info by merge request ID
 * Automaticly checkouts the correct branch
 * Backups dependencies
 * Reinstalls dependencies
 * Opens a new shell when the setup is done
 * Fully automatic cleanup after the shell is closed

Maybe for the future: 
    
 * Approve and merge MRs
 * ???
